# Movies-ETL

In this challenge I took raw data from website cleaned and transformed it into readable data, I create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into SQL tables.

Amazing Prime is an online retail company, the company wants to conduct a hackathon to figure out the latest movies they should get the rights for , I created the data we will give the hackathon participants so itâ€™s easy to analyze and come to clear predictions and conclusions.

Raw movie data scraped from web was very messy, I have Extracted the data, Cleaned the data and loaded into SQL table.

Goal acheived :

    1.Created an ETL pipeline from raw data to a SQL database.

    2.Extracted data from disparate sources using Python.

    3.Cleaned and transformed data using Pandas.

    4.Use regular expressions to parse data and to transform text into numbers.
    
    5.Loaded data with PostgreSQL.
